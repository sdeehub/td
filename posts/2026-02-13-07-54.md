Plurale Tantum (Plural Only) : Clothes • Scissors • Sunglasses (Goggles, Binoculars) • Riches (Belongings, Earnings) • Remains • Thanks • Outskirts (Premises, Surroundings) • Pants • Shenanigans (Nonsense) • Odds (By all odds - in every possible way; unquestionably)

*Clothe — a verb meaning "to dress someone or something."*
*While it's technically possible to talk about a single "outskirt", the idea of doing so has no real place in modern English. Stick to the plural form of the nounin these contexts.*

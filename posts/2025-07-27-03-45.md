Don't Complain: Keep your worries to yourself. Stay positive and do what you need to do with a smile.
• Believe in Yourself: Trust that you can do anything! Even if others say you cannot. Ignore negative comments and keep going.
• Say Sorry When You Are Wrong: Nobody knows everything. If you make a mistake, admit it quickly. This helps you learn faster.
• Follow Through: If you say you'll do something, make sure you do it. Your word is important.
• Saty Calm: Your feelings can affect your choices. People look to you for direction, so make clear and thoughtful decisions.
• Help Others: Many people feel lost. Understand what they need and guide them to a better path.

Is it okay to switch seats on an airplane?
- In fact, flight attendants prefer that you speak with them before making a switch - even to an empty seat.
- Pro tip: The best time to solve a seating issue is before you set foot on the plane. So, if you know youâ€™ll need a new seat assignment, chat with the gate agent before boarding begins.

You learn about the best ways to make money *because* you feel you don't have enough money already. • You stand in front of the mirror and repeat affirmations saying that you're beautiful *because* you feel as though you're not beautiful already. • You follow dating and relationship advice *because* you feel that you're unloveable already. • You try goofy visualization exercises about being more successful *because* you feel as though you aren't successful enough already.

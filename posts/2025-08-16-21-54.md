William James • he wrote that he would spend one year believing that he was 100 percent responsible for everything that occured in his life, no matter what.
During this period, he would do everything in his power to change his circumstance, no matter the likelihood of failure. If nothing improved in the year, then it would be apparent that he was truly powerless to the circumstances around him, and then he would take his own life.

We don't always control what happens to us. But we *always* control how we interpret what happens to us, as well as how we respond.

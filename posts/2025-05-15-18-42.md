You've been carrying a lot—balancing, supporting, refining, and adjusting. It's your nature to seek harmony, and that's a gift! But please, remember • *You don't have to hold the scales perfectly every day.*
Some days you tip a little. That's okay. That's human. What matters is your heart—hat brillant compass that know fairness, kindness, and quiet strength.
This year, you're stepping nto a chapter that's not about pleasing everyone. It's about *pleasing your soul*. You're allowed to say *no*. You're allowed to change direction. And you're absolutely allowed to be proud of how far you've come.

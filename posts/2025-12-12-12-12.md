She hasn't lost her beauty ... You have lost your sight. Because when you stop looking with love, everything starts to look *ugly*. And when you water with indifference, even the most beautiful flower withers.

A wife doesn't become young again through surgery or dermal fillers - but through kind words, gentle touches, and respect.
